## Array Methods

#### __pop:__

The pop() method simply removes the final element in the array, changing the length of said array and returning that element to the function caller.

#### __push:__

The push() method allows you to add any amount of elements to the end of your array. It also shows you the new length of said array.

#### __shift:__

The shift() method takes the first element from the array, changing the length of said array, and returning that element to the function caller.

#### __unshift:__

The unshift() allows you to add any amount of new elements to the beginning of an array, which in turn makes the length of the array longer.
