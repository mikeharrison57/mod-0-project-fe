# Section 3 Reflection

### 1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

I have thoroughly enjoyed how the sections of the Mod 0 project have developed. I think by progressively making each section a bit more challenging with regards to direction it prepared us well for the expectations of the full time program. It allowed us to figure out some concepts on our own, but also rely on some of our peers in the program should we need additional assistance. I also feel like section 3 in particular challenged us to combine some of the prior concepts from sections 1 and 2, which was an excellent test of how our knowledge of new JavaScript commands, keywords, concepts, etc. have stacked upon one another.

### 2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

Arrays are used to store lists of data or elements in one variable. They definitely appear to be very useful for software developers. There are countless examples of web and mobile applications that I can think of that likely utilize arrays, but I think one of the best examples is Spotify. Spotify has countless amounts of songs, playlists, artists, albums, podcasts, etc. Since arrays can be used to store unlimited amounts of elements, I would imagine that arrays are utilized to store and organize all of the elements on Spotify very frequently.  

### 3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are specialized functions that allow one to alter the elements stored on an array in a variety of different ways. For example, simple array methods such as .pop() and .shift() remove elements from the end of an array, and the beginning of an array respectively.  

### 4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops are used to perform actions via code multiple times. Typically, loops are utilized to make something repeat itself (I.E. printing a word or phrase multiple times, counting down or counting up, etc.). Using a loop in conjunction with an array can be very helpful, because it can segment the elements of said array by index position, and can even apply different messages, numbers, or values to the elements within an array. However, if you are dealing with one piece of data (string, number, or boolean), then it might be better to apply the loop to just that as opposed to an array.

### 5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

If I was explaining loops to a 5 year old, I would compare them to a playground. When a kid goes to a playground, they usually have multiple things that they like to do. They might want to slide on slides, climb on a jungle gym, swing on a swing, etc. However, I know when I was young there were certain activities that I liked to do more than once, and others I might do once or not at all. For example, let’s say a 5 year old kid really likes to swing, and go down slides, but doesn’t like to climb on a jungle gym as much. They can swing and go down the slide many times, like looping an action in code. They can also go down the slide different ways (back, stomach, side, etc.), and swing higher or lower on the swing. This is comparable to iterating different things into a looped array.  

### 6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

Can you have arrays within arrays, and if so how is that typically used? Are there other kinds of data we have yet to learn about that can also be stored in arrays? When will/should we learn about the different kinds of loops and how to use them?
