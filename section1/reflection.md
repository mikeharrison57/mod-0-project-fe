## Section 1 Reflection

#### 1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

In the past, I’ve had a tendency to wait a bit too long to ask questions that I should have. In relation to the, “Your Questions Are Ridiculous; Ask Them Anyway,” blogpost by Kathryn Grayson Nanz, I have stopped myself from asking questions in the past for the fear of looking dumb or inept at something. However, I now realize that it’s better to save myself the trouble of attempting to solve a problem for an exorbitant amount of time by instead reaching out to my peers, instructors, mentors, etc. for assistance with something I’m struggling with. In fact, over the course of this part of our project I did just that on one occasion. The solution to my problem was very simple, but I was unable to see it on my own, and one of my peers was able to help me fix the issue I was dealing with within minutes. I definitely plan on taking this approach going forward.

#### 2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The different data types that we learned about in this section of our project are strings, numbers, and booleans. These data types can be described as follows:

__Strings:__ Strings are letters, words, sentences, numbers, and or special characters represented in code. Any series of these things can be implemented into the code using single _‘’_ or double quotes _“”_ , but one must make sure to start and end the string with the same quotation.

__Numbers:__ Numbers are relatively self explanatory as they are just numbers represented in code. Negatives and decimals are also included, and one must always make sure to input large numbers without commas (I.E. 450300). Numbers with quotes are included in strings, which is different from numbers on their own.

__Booleans:__ Booleans are the most complex data type we have learned about thus far. They deal with the evaluation of values, and inform the user whether the comparison of said values is true or false. Equals to _===_ , lesser than _<_ , and greater than _>_ are all common values that can be assessed by a boolean data type (I.E. 3>5; false). This can be useful for things such as assessing whether or not something imputed by a user is true or false (I.E. usernames and passwords).  


#### 3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```
Console.log (“Hello World!")

```

#### 4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

Two _//_ symbols in succession are used to indicate code comments in a JavaScript file. These comments are useful for providing additional context and explanation about certain elements in our codes to fellow developers collaborating on a project. They are also useful for keeping certain parts of our code from running should they need to be fixed or altered.  

#### 5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

A variable in JavaScript is similar to an email template. Although you might reuse an email template over and over again, you typically have to plug in unique information every time you use said email template (I.E. different names, information, etc.). The three parts of a variable are the keyword var which simply allows JavaScript to know you are creating a variable, the name which is how you will plug it into future lines of code, and the value which is what information the name represents.

I believe the best way to go about explaining this concept to a 5 year old would be using a bag or school lunch analogy. For example, some schools have the same main dish on certain days of the week, and options for different side dishes. The main dishes of said lunch would be the variables in this scenario as the school is storing this kind of food and reusing it weekly. However, the different side dishes added to the meals are like other unique pieces of code that can be concatenated to variables.   

#### 6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

I use YouTube very frequently for music, education, and entertainment. One obvious variable that is likely used for my YouTube account in my username and password from my Google account. Since the two are linked, whenever I sign into my Google account and I open YouTube it automatically recognizes that it’s me. There must be a few boolean data types containing both my username and password that are automatically recognized as true when I open YouTube on a new computer well logged into my Google account.

Another likely variable for YouTube is their search functionality. After entering information into the search bar, it must have data available to try and find the closest results matching your search. There are probably many strings of data that your specific search gets compared to in order to connect you to said results.

A final variable I can think of with Youtube is their subscription service YoutubeRed. Some content on YouTube is made exclusively for this paid service, and typically can’t be watched unless you are subscribed to this service. This is most likely another boolean variable behind the scenes that recognizes if a user is a regular YouTube user or a YouTube Red subscriber.    

#### 7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatenation is similar to the word connection, and shares a similar meaning when applied to programming. To “concatenate” in code is to connect strings of data together in JavaScript. The _+_ symbol is used to couple these strings of data. This makes me think of welding. Typically in order to construct a complex metal object (i.e. suspension bridge, railing, fences, etc.) different metal pieces must be welded together. This is how I imagine concatenating code in JavaScript.

#### 8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

I’ve often used apps like Uber and Lyft in the past when I needed a ride somewhere. These two apps must use concatenation often in their codes. I believe this to be the case based on the factors that these apps take into consideration when you are arranging a ride. My home address is saved to my Uber and Lyft accounts. I believe this acts as a variable that gets plugged in every time I request a ride from my house. However, I’m usually taking Ubers/Lyfts to different locations of varying distances with different drivers. Therefore, I think that the variable of my home address is concatenated to these additional factors when I request a ride in order to figure out how much the ride will cost.

#### 9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

How are booleans best used in codes that we will eventually create?

Is there a rule of thumb about when we should use concatenation versus interpolation?

Are there any other beneficial or commonly used resources with regards to developing a better and more nuanced understanding of variables and how best to apply them to codes?
